# CUDA Matrix Multiplication Benchmark

This project provides a hands-on demonstration and performance comparison of two common methods for matrix multiplication using CUDA C++: a naive implementation and an optimized version using shared memory (tiling).

The primary goal is to illustrate the significant performance impact of memory optimization techniques in GPU programming. By minimizing access to slow global memory and leveraging fast on-chip shared memory, we can achieve a dramatic speedup.

## Features

*   **Naive Kernel (`matrixMulBasic`)**: A straightforward implementation where each thread calculates one element of the output matrix by repeatedly accessing global memory.
*   **Tiled Kernel (`matrixMulTiled`)**: An optimized implementation where threads in a block cooperatively load sub-matrices (tiles) into fast shared memory to perform the bulk of the computation.
*   **CPU Reference**: A simple, single-threaded CPU implementation used to verify the correctness of the GPU results.
*   **Performance Benchmarking**: Uses CUDA Events for accurate timing to measure and compare the execution time of both GPU kernels.
*   **Verification**: Compares the GPU output against the CPU output to ensure correctness.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Naive Global Memory Access

This method is intuitive but inefficient. For each element of the output matrix `C`, the corresponding row from matrix `A` and column from matrix `B` are read from global memory. Since global memory is off-chip, it has high latency, making this approach memory-bandwidth bound.

### 2. Tiled Shared Memory Optimization

This is a highly effective optimization technique. The core idea is to reduce the number of slow global memory reads.

*   **Tiling**: The input matrices `A` and `B` are partitioned into smaller square blocks called tiles.
*   **Cooperative Loading**: Each thread block loads one tile from `A` and one tile from `B` into a fast, on-chip **shared memory** space. This is a cooperative process where each thread in the block loads a small portion of the tiles.
*   **Synchronization**: The `__syncthreads()` intrinsic acts as a barrier, ensuring that all threads in a block have finished loading data into shared memory before any thread begins computation.
*   **Fast Computation**: Once the tiles are in shared memory, threads perform the matrix multiplication on this low-latency memory, drastically reducing the number of accesses to global memory.

The benchmark will clearly show that the tiled approach is significantly faster, often by an order of magnitude or more.

## Prerequisites

*   An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support.
*   The [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (version 11.x or 12.x recommended), which includes the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (`nvcc`).

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the Code**: Save the provided source code as `benchmark_matrix_mul.cu`.

2.  **Compile**: Open your terminal or command prompt and use `nvcc` to compile the code.

    ```bash
    nvcc -o benchmark_matrix_mul benchmark_matrix_mul.cu -arch=sm_75
    ```

    > **Note on `-arch` flag**: The `-arch=sm_75` flag specifies the target GPU architecture (Compute Capability 7.5 in this case, for a Turing-based GPU). You should change this to match your GPU for best performance (e.g., `sm_86` for Ampere, `sm_90` for Hopper). If you are unsure, you can often omit the flag, and `nvcc` will use a default architecture.

3.  **Execute**: Run the compiled binary from your terminal.

    ```bash
    ./benchmark_matrix_mul
    ```

## Example Output

The exact timing results will vary significantly depending on your GPU, but the output structure will look like this. Note the substantial performance difference between the two methods.
